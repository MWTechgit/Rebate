## Updating rebate quantity:
When you increase rebates remaining, also increase the rebate
inventory by the same number.
    
## Feature Request:
Note what city has spent per fiscal year.
I don't remember the details of this request.
Will have to ask later.

## Fiscal Year
The old app is using the calendar year as the fiscal year.
We should use the actual fiscal year.

No partner has more than one active for rebate for the current fiscal year.

I was hoping we could drop old data but Sam said they still need that info.
They don't need to keep old rebate document files.

The map shows the water supplier in case they put in
the wrong water supplier.
