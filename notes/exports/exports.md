# Exports

There are two reasons for exporting data:
1. Admin use (mailing lists, look at data, etc.)
2. Send to accounting

These exports are done in two different locations.
1. Admin Use - `applications/export_data` (from dashboard)
2. Accounting - `/export` (nav link)

Exports for admin use have multiple options
- let's just do one format and get feedback
